# Welcome to the tutorial "from-Excel-to-Pandas" for data analysis

This is a guide for data analysts that are fluent with Excel and want to modernize their analyses to Python and mainly using the Pandas library. This tutorial is **NOT** teaching programing in Python, as it is focused on the FUNCTIONs to implement in a sequence to achieve the result of an analysis. This simple multi-step flow of functions makes the analysis easier to understand and follow, and also to run the analyses in a consistent way in the future and across the organization. 

The tutorial is based on a set of Jupyter notebooks demonstrating the various ways to implement the main functions that are available in Microsoft Excel with their Pandas equivalents. You can jump directly to a specific section by searching the Excel function name or read through the tutorial to learn the basic and advanced topics. The tutorial is organized in complexity order and the later chapters assume the knowledge that is covered in earlier ones.
